# Hey there, I'm @Skoldz! 👋


## About Me 🌴🔬💻

Born in the heart-stirring landscapes of New Caledonia and currently soaking up the vibrant culture of Sydney, I'm a curious explorer at heart and a student by trade. I'm navigating the fascinating world of Applied Medical Science at the University of Sydney, diving deep into the mysteries of the human body and how science can be a beacon of hope and innovation in healthcare.

But wait, there's more! 🚀

As much as I love the adrenaline rush of scientific discoveries and medical marvels, I've recently caught the coding bug. Why? Because it's downright fun and the possibilities seem endless. It's like learning a new language that can create, solve, and innovate in ways I never imagined. Plus, who knows? This newfound passion might just be the start of an exciting career pivot. Stay tuned!

## Why Coding? 🤔

- **It's Creative**: Crafting code to bring ideas to life is like painting, but instead of a canvas, you have a screen. Every line of code is a stroke of creativity.
- **It's Challenging**: Every bug is a puzzle waiting to be solved. It keeps the brain sharp and the spirit invigorated.
- **It's Impactful**: From healthcare apps to data analysis in medical research, coding holds the potential to revolutionize the field I'm deeply passionate about.

## Let's Connect! 🌏

Whether you're a fellow student, a coding enthusiast, or just someone who loves to chat about science and technology, I'm all ears. Let's share ideas, collaborate on projects, or just have a good old geek-out session about the latest in tech and health.
